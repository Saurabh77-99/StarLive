Chrome browser --> Camera turn on --> start streaming button -> RTMP    

stream --> sended to --> NodeJS server (child process) that runs CLI ffmpeg tools
for any type of video-processing --> ffmpeg is tool.--> to given RTMP points

RTMP -> Real time messaging protocol 

yt live streaming --> thrown to --> RTMP of yt server

### How does RTMP works?

capture -> encoding -> processing -> playback

Stream videos form one to another we need UDP / WEBRTC protocol

RTMP is a TCP protocol.
User stream -> convert to -> binary data 
so that over TCP protocol, the stream is sended to nodejs server , and by ffmpeg the binary data is thrown to RTMP server.

For this communication, to send binary data to NodeJS server , it can be done by socket.io or web sockets.

-------

we can't throw media stream on RTMP.
we need to convert it to binary data.
